# Notebooks

This folder contains three notebooks:

* [`intro-to-dask.ipynb`](./intro-to-dask.ipynb) provides a short introduction to the Dask parallel computing library.
* [`step1_train_on_cutout.ipynb`](./step1_train_on_cutout.ipynb) dives into a use case, showing how to traine a simple binary classifier on a scene cutout;
* [`step2_prediction_on_large_data.ipynb`](./step2_prediction_on_large_data.ipynb) shows how to "map" the trained model to a large RGB image using Xarray and Dask.

Beside these, [`data_preparation/data_preparation.ipynb`](./data_preparation/data_preparation.ipynb) provides a reference for how the example dataset has been generated.
